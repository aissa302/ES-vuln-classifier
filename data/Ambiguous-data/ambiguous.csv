CVE-2023-25139 ,"sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes."
CVE-2022-39046 ,"An issue was discovered in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.36. When the syslog function is passed a crafted input string larger than 1024 bytes, it reads uninitialized memory from the heap and prints it to the target log file, potentially revealing a portion of the contents of the heap."
CVE-2021-3999  ,"A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system."
CVE-2021-3998  ,"A flaw was found in glibc. The realpath() function can mistakenly return an unexpected value, potentially leading to information leakage and disclosure of sensitive data."
CVE-2022-32221 ,"When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST."
CVE-2022-40320 ,"cfg_tilde_expand in confuse.c in libConfuse 3.3 has a heap-based buffer over-read."
CVE-2023-28113 ,"When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST."
CVE-2023-23916 ,"An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 based on the chained HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of acceptable links in this decompression chain wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a malloc bomb, making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors."
CVE-2023-23915 ,"A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality to behave incorrectly when multiple URLs are requested in parallel. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recentlycompleted transfer. A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then *not* get upgraded properly to HSTS."
CVE-2022-42915 ,"curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0."
CVE-2022-27780 ,"The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like '/'when decoding the host name part of a URL, making it a *different* URL usingthe wrong host name when it is later retrieved.For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F127.0.0.1/`, would be allowed bythe parser and get transposed into `http://example.com/127.0.0.1/`. This flawcan be used to circumvent filters, checks and more."
CVE-2022-27776 ,"A insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability in fixed in curl 7.83.0 might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number."
CVE-2022-27775 ,"An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl 7.65.0 to 7.82.0 are vulnerable that by using an IPv6 address that was in the connection pool but with a different zone id it could reuse a connection instead."
CVE-2022-27774 ,"An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in curl 4.9 to and include curl 7.82.0 are affected that could allow an attacker to extract credentials when follows HTTP(S) redirects is used with authentication could leak credentials to other services that exist on different protocols or port numbers."
CVE-2021-31987 ,"A user controlled parameter related to SMTP test functionality is not correctly validated making it possible to bypass blocked network recipients."
CVE-2021-31986 ,"User controlled parameters related to SMTP notifications are not correctly validated. This can lead to a buffer overflow resulting in crashes and data leakage."
CVE-2023-1249  ,"A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Ext4 File System in how a user triggers several file operations simultaneously with the overlay FS usage. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Only if patch 9a2544037600 (ovl: fix use after free in struct ovl_aio_req) not applied yet, the kernel could be affected."
CVE-2023-28772 ,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3. lib/seq_buf.c has a seq_buf_putmem_hex buffer overflow."
CVE-2022-40540 ,"Memory corruption due to buffer copy without checking the size of input while loading firmware in Linux Kernel."
