A remote attacker can disable the virus warning mechanism in the software.,ambiguous
The application does not warn a user when a macro is present in a Symbolic Link (SYLK) format file.,ambiguous
Modifications to ACLs (Access Control Lists) in the application do not take effect until the directory store cache is refreshed.,ambiguous
"The product does not properly handle (1) malformed NNTP data, or (2) malformed SMTP data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application error).",ambiguous
the software allow remote attackers to inject 802.1q frames into another VLAN by forging the VLAN identifier in the trunking tag.,ambiguous
"The protocol does not use authentication, which allows remote attackers to redirect HTTP traffic to arbitrary hosts via packets to UDP port 2048.",ambiguous
"The system does not properly initialize the disk space used by its application files and effectively inserts data from previously deleted files into the application file, which could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information.",ambiguous
"The system does not properly handle extended IP access lists when the IP route cache is enabled and the established keyword is set, which could allow attackers to bypass filters.",ambiguous
"Buffer overflow in the software allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root via a long string beginning with NLPS:002:002: to the listen (aka System V listener) port, TCP port 2766.",ambiguous
The system allows a user to gain access to the enable mode without a password.,ambiguous
"The product allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending the ENVIRON option to the Telnet daemon before it is ready to accept it, which causes the system to reboot.",ambiguous
"The system allows attackers with access to the login prompt to obtain portions of the command history of previous users, which may allow the attacker to access sensitive data.",ambiguous
The product allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by specifying a malicious .dll using the Register.ID function.,ambiguous
Buffer overflow in the HTML interpreter allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands via a long embedded object tag,ambiguous
"When the document is launched, the directory of that document is first used to locate DLL's such as riched20.dll and msi.dll, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by inserting a Trojan Horse DLL into the same directory as the document.",ambiguous
The HTTP server allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash and reload) via a URL containing a ?/ string.,ambiguous
"The software does not properly handle a MIME header with a blank charset specified, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a charset= command, aka the Malformed MIME Header vulnerability.",ambiguous
"The installation of the applicaton creates a user account with a known password, which could allow attackers to gain privileges, aka the Exchange User Account vulnerability.",ambiguous
Memory leak in the software allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a series of failed telnet authentication attempts.,ambiguous
"the system allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by connecting to the SSH service with a non-SSH client, which generates a protocol mismatch error.",ambiguous
The vulnerability allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation error) by repeatedly sending a series of specially formatted URL's.,ambiguous
Buffer overflow in the commnunication protocol allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a long registration request (URL) to fp30reg.dll.,ambiguous
"The software will forward an 802.1x frame on a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) blocked port, which causes a network storm and a denial of service.",ambiguous
"Insecure default configurations in the product's web server expose unnecessary services and functionalities, increasing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.",ambiguous
Inadequate protection against HTTP smuggling attacks within the product's web server enables attackers to bypass security controls and potentially carry out request smuggling or cache poisoning.,ambiguous
