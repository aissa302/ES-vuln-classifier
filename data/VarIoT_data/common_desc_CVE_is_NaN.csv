"IPUX is a provider of network monitoring solutions. Multiple IPUX network cameras (IPUX ICL5132 and ICL5452) have buffer overflows in their implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of an affected system. IPUX IP Camera is a webcam device. IPUX IP Camera UltraSVCam ActiveX space 'UltraSVCamX.ocx' has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can cause memory corruption when a large number of bytes are passed to multiple functions in UltraSVCamLib, causing an application to crash or execute arbitrary code. Multiple IPUX IP Camera products are prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions. IPUX ICL5132 and ICL5452 are vulnerable. The device is H.264 Wired/Wireless IP Camera with 1.3 Mega-pixel sensor.With high performance H.264 video compression, the file size of video stream isextremely reduced, as to optimize the network bandwidth efficiency. It has fullPan/Tilt function and 3X digital zoom feature for a larger space monitoring. Thebuilt-in USB port provides a convenient and portable storage option for local storageof event and schedule recording, especially network disconnected.The UltraSVCam ActiveX Control 'UltraSVCamX.ocx' suffers from a stack bufferoverflow vulnerability when parsing large amount of bytes to several functions inUltraSVCamLib, resulting in memory corruption overwriting several registers includingthe SEH.

"The Schneider Electric Group provides products and services in the areas of energy and infrastructure, industry, data centers and networks, buildings and homes. Multiple Schneider Electric multiple products. The Modbus series driver has a buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing a project in ""Programming"" mode, which can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution. Exploiting this vulnerability requires enticing users to open malicious project files. Multiple Schneider Electric products are prone to a local buffer-overflow vulnerability because they fail to properly validate user-supplied input before copying it into a fixed-length buffer. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition. The following products are vulnerable: TwidoSuite versions 2.31.04 and prior PowerSuite versions 2.6 and prior SoMove versions 1.7 and prior SoMachine versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.0 XS Unity Pro versions 7.0 and prior UnityLoader versions 2.3 and prior Concept versions 2.6 SR7 and prior ModbusCommDTM sl versions 2.1.2 and prior PL7 versions 4.5 SP5 and prior SFT2841 version 14 and versions 13.1 and prior OFS versions 3.50 and prior",common
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Samsung Galaxy S10. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the handling of arrays in FileWriterImpl::Write. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and escape the Chromium sandbox.,common

"LEADTOOLS Imaging Common Dialogs provides professional-grade imaging common dialogs for graphics processing, transformations, and effects. The LtocxImgEfxDlgu. ActiveX control provided by Imaging Common Dialogs does not properly filter input parameters. Users who are tricked into accessing malicious web pages and transmitting long parameters may cause arbitrary code execution. An attacker may exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application (typically Internet Explorer) that invoked the ActiveX control. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition. Product Web Page: http://www.leadtools.com Affected version: 16.5.0.2 Summary: With LEADTOOLS you can control any scanner, digital camera or capture card that has a TWAIN (32 and 64 bit) device driver. High-level acquisition support is included for ease of use while low-level functionality is provided for flexibility and control in even the most demanding scanning applications.
