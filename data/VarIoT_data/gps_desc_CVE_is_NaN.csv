"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Ecava IntegraXor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PCX files within the Inkscape component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",gps

"UWinTech Pro control engineering application software platform professional version is based on multi-platform heterogeneous systems such as Windows 7 / Windows XP and real-time OS. It adopts multi-tasking, multi-threading and component structure design technologies. It integrates field data collection, I / O module diagnostic configuration, and distributed real-time. Database, control algorithm real-time execution, graphic monitoring and real-time software are run on different levels of hardware platforms respectively. Through the control network and the system network, various data, management and control information are exchanged to coordinately complete the various distributed control systems. Features. An unauthorized access vulnerability exists in the UWinTech Pro control engineering application software platform. Attackers can use this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information",gps
"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ecava IntegraXor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMF files within the Inkscape component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",gps
"DSS (Digital Surveillance System) is a highly integrated and powerful digital monitoring management system developed by Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., Ltd. Zhejiang Dahua's new DSS 3.0 security platform uses Apache Struts 2 as the website application framework. Because the software has a remote code execution high-risk vulnerability, attackers can use the vulnerability to gain remote control of the web server host.",gps
